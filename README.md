This solution is portable on windows os. When building Angular projects the front end doesn't always hot load as expected when making updates for whatever reason ( mismatched images on disks with memory) the server crashes and need to be restarted. This ps script will test the port to see if anything is listening on it. It will automatically find the port the Angular server is using should the user pick one other than the default (4200). It will make 3 attempt to restart the server (killing the process tree to ensure there are no orphans) if nothing is listening and then leave a message in your log file. I tested it but if you should have any issues please DM me here.
